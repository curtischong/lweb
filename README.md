Lizzie is really taking over my life.

So what's LWeb? This is the chrome extension for Lizzie. Since I soend a lot of time talking and learning things online, I want to record:
1. (only my) Messenger texts (and texts that I've deleted and haven't sent)
  i I love NLP
  ii I want to see the difference between my first draft and sent conversations
  iii I want to tie in my linquistic habits to see if I'm expanding my vocabulary
  iv It's another datapoint to gauge mood
    - I can spin off personalized Mental health services if I catch myself early on
  v if I'm being rude
    - So many services I can link in.
      - record times I was rude. <- important for self-improvement
      - display a message to tell myself to take a walk.
  vi How I communicate to different people
  vii How I can improve conversation quality for all future conversations
  
2. All the text I type in textboxes online
 i See how I am progressing as a software engineer. Am I getting the answers I need in a fast manner?
 ii I can compare how I talk to others online to how I talk to friends (lottttssssssss of NLP)

3. All the websites I visit and usage statistics
 i Just curious
 ii Perhaps I can use it to alter habits

So yeah. That's LWeb. It's a small component but one of the most important ones. The data it collects is also one of the highest returns I can receive for every developer hour I put in.

Hope you find my scripts useful!
