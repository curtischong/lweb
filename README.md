Whoa Lizzie is really taking over my life.

So what's LWeb? This is the chrome extension for Lizzie. Since I spend a lot of time talking and learning things online, I want to record:
1. (only my) Messenger texts (and texts that I've deleted and haven't sent)
  - I want to do this because I love NLP
  - I want to see the difference between my first draft and sent conversations
  - I want to tie in my linquistic habits to see if I'm expanding my vocabulary
  - It's another datapoint to gauge mood
    - I can spin off personalized Mental health services if I catch myself early on
  - if I'm being rude
    - So many services I can link in.
      - record times I was rude. <- important for self-improvement
      - display a message to tell myself to take a walk.
  - How I communicate to different people
  - How I can improve conversation quality for all future conversations
  
2. All the text I type in textboxes online
 - See how I am progressing as a software engineer. Am I getting the answers I need in a fast manner?
 - I can compare how I talk to others online to how I talk to friends (lottttssssssss of NLP)

3. All the websites I visit and usage statistics
 - Just curious
 - Perhaps I can use it to alter habits

So yeah. That's LWeb. It's a small component but one of the most important ones. The data it collects is also one of the highest returns I can receive for every developer hour I put in.

Hope you find my scripts useful!
